## Orders number
On printed Navy Orders, the BUPERS Orders number is originally formatted as "`<N_ORDER_CNTL_NBR> <EMPLID>`", for example, "`3108 000-12-3456`". It would be unique (because of the SSN), except that itâ€™s possible for a set of orders to be cut on the same day 10 years later for the same sailor, resulting in a collision.

Because the BUPERS Orders Number contains PII (the SSN) and could potentially not be unique (because it only allows a single digit for the year), the Orders API expects the Orders number to be reformatted as "`{Julian day}{4 digit year} {EDIPI}`", for example, "`3102018 0123456789`". The full 4 digit year can be found in the N_ORD_DT field of the first revision, while the EDIPI can be retrieved using DMDC's Identity Web Services.

## Modification number interpretation
The Orders API has a sequence number to indicate the chronology of amendments to a set of Orders. The input, however, has two modification number fields: `N_MOD_NUM` and `N_MOD_NBR`. Fortunately, these two fields increment atomically, and never decrement.

Therefore, the sequence number is simply the sum of `N_MOD_NUM` and `N_MOD_NBR`.

## Orders type
To determine the effective orders type, lookup the purpose (`N_CIC_PURP`) and community (enlisted or officer) in the following table.

| N_CIC_PURP | Enlisted / Officer | Description | Effective Orders Type |

## Ranks
The `N_RATE_RANK` column contains Navy rank (officer) and rate (enlisted) abbreviations. These abbreviations need to be translated to titles and DoD pay grades.

### Enlisted Rates
To determine the title and pay grade for enlisted rates, if the abbreviation does not have a simple translation, then match the rating suffix to first match the stem of the abbreviation to the job title, and then determine the prefix or suffix of the title using the remainder of the abbreviation in the rates table.

#### Bare enlisted rates and paygrades
The most senior enlisted rates have a simple translation from abbreviation to title and pay grade.

The lowest enlisted paygrades without ratings are also easy to translate.
